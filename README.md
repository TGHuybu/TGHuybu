# Welcome to my unprofessional profile :3 

## 🤡 About me
My name is Huy, I'm currently a student at the **Faculty of Information Technology at the University of Science in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam**. Even tho I'm doing a degree in IT, it has been somewhat of my life long dream (actually ever since 11th grade) to use computers to study the universe!

## 🔭 About my work
You think I, an IT sophomore, am employed? Well then you'd be wrong, I go jobless...\
But on a serious note, I'm a research assistant for Dr. Dieu Nguyen of CRAL (Centre de Recherche Astrophysique de Lyon, France), where
I had the chance to *touch* some of the most interesting tools used in astrophysics research, and learn in one of the most interesting
field of science: *✨ **P H Y S I C S** ✨*<sub><sup>much wow, i'm really bad at maths tho</sup><sub>
