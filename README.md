# Welcome to my unprofessional profile :3 

## 🤡 About me
My name is Huy, I'm currently a student at the **Faculty of Information Technology at the University of Science in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam**. Even tho I'm doing a degree in IT, it has been somewhat of my life long dream (actually ever since 11th grade) to use computers to study the universe!

## 🔭 About my work
You think I, an IT sophomore, am employed? Well then you'd be wrong, I go jobless...\
But on a serious note, I'm a research assistant for Dr. Dieu Nguyen of CRAL (Centre de Recherche Astrophysique de Lyon, France), where
I had the chance to *touch* some of the most interesting tools used in astrophysics research, and learn in one of the most interesting
field of science: *✨ **P H Y S I C S** ✨*<sub><sup>much wow, i'm really bad at maths tho</sup></sub>

## 🎶 Something personal
I enjoy listening to music (mostly Japanese rock), I personally recommend these bands: 'ASIAN KUNG-FU GENERATION', 'kurayamisaka', and 'bungeitengoku',
please do feel free to check out my playlist of [good stuff](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2CrWA3JsS5QzoBbQiOF3ZO?si=2ee2bf29b1784fb2).\
I watch animes too! My favourite has got to be 'A Place Further than the Universe', really life-changing!\
<sub><sup>I also like to lie down and cry myself to sleep in my free time</sup></sub>

## 🏆 Do I have any notable achievement?
No.
